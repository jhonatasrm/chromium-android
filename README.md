- Clarify the project business logic can completely fit for domestic company engineer
- This project will follow up and update Google browser kernel version for a long time

### Considerations
In 2015, Google releases full source of chromium for android, including browser UI. It means that base on chromium open source project, you can build an android browser as powerful as Chrome for Android. But for most android developer, chromium project is huge and difficult to customize. This project extracts sources and libraries built from chromium, so that you can put emphasis on UI customize. Please use Android Studio as your development environment.
### The build process

Check out the repository in your Android Studio workspace, and open the project in Android Studio. Then build, debug, run as a normal android project.
